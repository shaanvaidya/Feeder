Note:
After one time use, if the app is built again, the app would stop working, so to get around that, uncomment line number 65 in MainActivity.java, build, comment the line
We have not implemented the 'view feedback' feature, so to test if the feedbacks were added as required, one could use Django's admin page



Reflection Essay:

It all ends here, one would say, but I would argue that this is in fact a new beginning.
The project was the one thing we worked the most on in this course. At face value, learning a plethora of new things would seem quite daunting and so it did. But once the structure of how things worked became clearer, it was just a matter if finding the correct ways to do things. Django was perhaps the easier of the two, at least for us. Android Studio did keep giving random pains, but once we figured out what the errors were, they didn't feel so random, in fact, such pedanticism about things is the reason that working apps are so stable because otherwise there is an infinite number of things that could go wrong and one would never know about it. Django was fun! Creating models, relating them, passing data between views, etc. 
We do regret that we weren't able to accomplish all of the features and we apologise for it. It was sheer incompetence on our part that led to our not being able to complete the whole thing in the stipulated time. We learnt a lot (first thing being, BEGIN EARLY!) in the course of the project.
All in all, the whole course has been a enriching journey. When we look back, we find that we are much more confident in walking into untested waters now than we were before. Bring it on!
We also thank the whole teaching team for the course, for making it so much fun!
