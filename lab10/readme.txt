Note:
Two feedbacks and deadline are created on adding the course, they can be seen on the shell or the website's admin account
Create Feedback form view is still under construction (Uh It doesn't work).

Reflection Essay:
The task seemed quite daunting at first. Working with so many files, understanding what each file is used for, once learnt made the work real smooth.
We were daft enough to waste almost a day in fixing the bug regarding versions of django (Many tutorials use older, now deprecated, syntax)
We worked from one laptop only, so all commits are from the same account, sorry about that. 
It seems we need to get more comfortable about working in a team (push, pull still give us nightmares!)
Once we got going, it was actually quite fun! 
It takes two to tango but one to django. (Yeah, it doesn't make sense, but I just felt like writing it)
